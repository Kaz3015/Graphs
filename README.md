This project deals with graphs and locations. The map in this file was made into a graph which represents streets around northeastern. When given a start and end location it can give directions on where to go. This does not have user interface, but if you open up the file you can run it to see if the tests passed. If you want to test it out change the check-expects to a different start and end location and follow the map to see if it made the right directions.
