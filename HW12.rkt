;; Exercise 1

(define-struct node [label])
;; A Node is a (make-node String)
;; Interpretation: A (make-node label) represents the label of a node in a graph
;; Examples:
(define ND1 (make-node "A"))
(define ND2 (make-node "B"))
(define ND3 (make-node "C"))
(define ND4 (make-node "D"))
(define ND5 (make-node "E"))

(define-struct edge [start end direction])
;; An Edge is a (make-edge String Node Node Boolean)
;; Interpretation: A (make-edge label start end both-ways?) contains the edge's label, the start and
;; end node of the edge, and whether or not it is a two-way connection.
;; Examples:
(define EDGE-1 (make-edge "A->B" ND1 ND2))
(define EDGE-2 (make-edge "C->D" ND3 ND4))
(define EDGE-3 (make-edge "E->B" ND5 ND2))

(define-struct elgraph [nodes edges])
;; An ELGraph is a (make-elgraph [List-of Nodes] [List-of Edges])
;; Interpretation: An ELGraph represents a graph with labeled nodes and edges
;; Examples:
(define ELG-1 (make-elgraph (list ND1 ND2 ND3 ND4 ND5) (list EDGE-1 EDGE-2 EDGE-3)))
(define ELG-2 (make-elgraph (list ND1 ND2) (list EDGE-1)))
